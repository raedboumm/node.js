# Node.js Tasks README

## Task 1: hello-world.js
Created a simple Node.js script (`hello-world.js`) to print "HELLO WORLD" to the console.

## Task 2: Simple Server
Developed a basic Node.js server (`simple-server.js`) that runs on port 3000 and responds with `<h1>Hello Node!!!!</h1>` when accessed at http://localhost:3000.

## Task 3: Read and Console.log Data
Enhanced the server to include file system functionality, creating a file named "welcome.txt" and reading and logging data from "hello.txt".

## Task 4: Password Generator
Established a Node.js script (`password-generator.js`) utilizing the `generate-password` npm package to generate and log random passwords.

## Task 5: Email Sender
Implemented an email-sending script (`email-sender.js`) using the `nodemailer` npm package to send an email to a specified recipient.

Note: Ensure to replace placeholder values in `email-sender.js` with your actual email and password. Be cautious with sensitive information in public repositories.
